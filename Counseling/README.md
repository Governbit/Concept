# Counseling
This system can behave as a means to communicate bi-directionally from citizens to politicians who represent those citizens. Because of this, at times politicians may need to counsel the citizens. This can be offered through the system in a way that users can supply feedback on which pieces of counsel they subscribe to from multiple counselors.

This feature can be offered in a way that is both informative and interactive.
