# Counseling
This system can behave as a means to communicate bi-directionally between citizens and politicians. Because of this, at times politicians may need to offer counseling from their political experience. This can be offered through the system in a way that users can supply feedback on which pieces of counsel they subscribe and from which politicians.

This feature can be offered in a way that is both informative and interactive.
