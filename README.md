# Concept
The concept of Governbit as an organization is to provide the citizens of a government the ability to report on their own beliefs and standings on governmental/political issues. That feedback from all of the users can then be reported on at large scale where it can be useful in decision making for politicians.

Feedback from real-world policy results can be collected and fed back into the system, to allow the system to be aware and report on predictions vs. actuals.

Data is collected and geo-tagged so that the reporting can be done with geographical aspects considered. Other information about the individual is collected like nationality, sex, and age in order to ensure that these various demographics are treated equally. This data is collected while removing anything that ties the data to the individual. The information the system reports on individuals collectively is an abstraction and should remain in no ways personal.

In order for this to work, an ellaborate system must exist. A part of this system is a piece that needs to function as a business. This is for managing expenses for things like (but not limited to): business expenses and digital footprint. These will be elaborated on more in this repository.

A digital footprint example is: We know this system should have a web portal for users to access and provide their feedback. That web portal costs money for hosting on the internet. Especially considering how many users it may accumulate. So it must be able to scale based on demand. Also, governbit.com and some variants of the name have been purchased and must be maintained.

The digital systems required to build a technology are relatively straight-forward, but they are extensive. One goal of this system is to remain 100% transparent. In addition, this system should be collaborated on by anyone, no matter your profession or political prowess. Everything is being open-sourced here on GitHub.
